JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.
It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications
(e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa).

JSON is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by Douglas Crockford.
Even though it closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax,
it can be used independently from JavaScript, and many programming environments feature the ability to read (parse) and generate JSON.

JSON exists as a string — useful when you want to transmit data across a network.
It needs to be converted to a native JavaScript object when you want to access the data.
This is not a big issue — JavaScript provides a global JSON object that has methods available for converting between the two.
