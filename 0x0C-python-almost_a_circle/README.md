*args and **kwargs are mostly used in function definitions.
*args and **kwargs allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function.
What does variable mean here is that you do not know before hand
that how many arguments can be passed to your function by the user
so in this case you use these two keywords.
*args is used to send a non-keyworded variable length argument list to the function.

**kwargs allows you to pass keyworded variable length of arguments to a function.
You should use **kwargs if you want to handle named arguments in a function.
